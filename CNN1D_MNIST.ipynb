    "- The MNIST dataset is a collection of 70,000 images of handwritten digits, where each image is a grayscale 28x28 pixel image representing digits from 0 to 9. \n",
    "- It is commonly used for image classification tasks, particularly in the field of deep learning. \n",
    "- The dataset is split into a training set of 60,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images. \n",
    "- Each image is associated with a label representing the corresponding digit, making MNIST a supervised learning dataset.\n",
    "- MNIST serves as a benchmark in machine learning and deep learning for testing algorithms."
